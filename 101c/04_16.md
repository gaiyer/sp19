### Rhetoric ###
* Rhetoric = art of speaking, etc
* "The way you deliver your content determines its effectiveness"
* cliches / patterns / structure in speech

TODO: read "Music in the Galant Style"

## Phrase Structure - Schoenberg ##
* Two main concepts: "sentence" and "period" as modular structures
** fragmentation is a break-down / "cherry-picking" of the basic idea
**
* Beethoven's kind of the first person to do this
* Beethoven: Op 2, No 1, mm1-8
** 2 bars basic idea (ionic) --> 2 bars repetition of b.i. (dominant) --> 2 bars continuation/fragmentation --> 2 bars cadential idea
** essentially it's always presentation of the idea (first 4 bars), then continuation / fragmentation (second four bars) then closure
** harmonic structure is not that important, it's the movement of melody
* Mozart: K 485 mm9-16
** presentation = 4 bars, basic idea, 2 bars. I - V7 - V7 - I
** next is 1-bar chunks of IV -> I (harmonic rhythm speeds up)

## Sentence ##
### Presentation components ###
* basic idea
* exact repetition (can be slightly rhythmically changed)
** this is like an "insistence" of the basic idea
** doesn't have to be in the same notes (i.e. could be shifted)
* statement - response
* sequential repetition
** can totally do this by going between I <--> V

### Continuation components ###
* uhhh

## Period ##
* often 4 bars antecedant (question), 4 bars consequent (answer)
** scale degree that a phrase ends on is important (finishing on the second degree vs first)
** common way = Q: I->V, A: I->I
*** the way you HEAR the answer is because both statements start the same
* effective mapping of harmonic function
* can make an "obvious claim" about repetition even if it's not perfect
* the antecedant itself can have a sentence structure (repetition, continuation etc)
** example: Mozart K 331, i, mm1-8
