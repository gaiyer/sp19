# Cache #

## handling writes ##

### write-back write-allocate ###
* inclusive hash: if storing A1 and A1 is a hit (stored) in L1 cache, it is also in all the other cashes
	* write-back cache: new value is updated in L1 and the dirty bit is updated to 1
	* in all the other lower caches, the value is outdated
* if A1 is NOT in L1, it's a miss at L1
	* write-allocate: copy the whole OLD cache block from whatever lower level cache all the way up to every instance above it
	* THEN add to L1 with new value and dirty bit
* whenever you have write-back, you WILL have write-allocate

### write-through write-no-allocate ###
* on write hit: if storing A1 is in L1, it is also in all other caches
	* new value is updated in L1 AND every cache below it
* on write miss:
	* write directly to main memory - don't bring cache block into upper cache
	* there is no copy function from lower level to upper

## range of set associative caches ##
* four-way set-associative: how does the cache look after each access?
	* HW 3 has stuff like this

## tag overhead ##
* cache capacity is only in the data (dirty-bit/tag isn't)
* DRAM: main memory organization

## DRAM bank operation (open row policy) ##
* row address (e.g. 0) goes through row decoder to bank and pulls the entire row 0 into the row buffer (called activating)
* then, sent through column mux (column decoder) for column address (e.g. 0) for data
* if now accessing (row=0, col=1), row buffer has a HIT and don't need to actually access bank (just use column mux )
* = write-back cache
	* closed-row policy = write-through cache
