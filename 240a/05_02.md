# Lecture 5: Out of Order Execution #

### Review: ###
* What's inside a branch predictor?
	* go over 2-bit branch prediction example from class
* hardware multithreading
	* sequential stream of instructions (NOT the same as software)
	* multiple hardware threads dynamically share a single pipeline
	* replicate only per-thread structures: PC and register
	* hardware interleaves instructions w/ hardware logic
	* know the difference between coarse granularity, fine granularity, and SMT (simultaneous multithreading)
* be able to write out pipelined diagram given assembly instructions

## Instruction Scheduling ##
* what order are instructions executed? doesn't necessarily match order in software (as long as program is correct)
* what's the role of hardware vs software in the order? static vs dynamic scheduling, respectively

# Dynamic OoO approaches #
* scoreboarding and tomasulo
* an in-order pipeline
	* for the execution stage, there are different # of cycles (i.e. int add vs float mul)
	* DISPATCH: act of sending an instruction to an execution functional unit
		* longer execution instructions should be dispatched first
* preventing dispatch stalls:
	* fine-grained multithreading
	* .... other stuff

## Dynamic Scheduling ##
* move dependent instructions out of the way so that independent ones can executed
	* resting instructions wait in "reservation stations"
* out-of-order EXECUTION (dispatch) means that the Fetch and the Write-Back stages are still ALL in order
	* only execution and memory accesses can be out of order really

## Tomasulo's Algorithm ##
* the one with "stations" where instructions "wait"
* so it's really in-order, then insns go into a reservation station to become out-of-order, then are put back in order for write back
* reservation station (issue queue):
	* can be implemented as RAM (read/write specific value), CAM (search for value), or both

## Reservation Station Details ##
Register Renaming
* some dependencies are just dependencies bc there aren't enough registers in the ISA
	* true data dependency would be read after write
* tradeoff between cost & efficiency
	* reservation station is not just a bank, there's a map table to support register Renaming
	* maps virtual r3 with physical p6 (both registers will have the same value at instantiation)
