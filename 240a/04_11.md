# Lecture 4: Performance & ISA #

## Review ##
* latency, throughput, speedup
* CPI = latency, IPC = throughput
* avg performance: arithmetic, harmonic, geometric mean
* measuring CPU perf
* performance laws: amdahl's, little's laws
* benchmarks

## Amdahl's Law ##
can be applied to anything, including budgets
- improve the thing that takes up the most
- look at the video from class for
"how much does an optimization improve performance?"

## Pitfalls of Partial Performance Metrics ##
* people thing frequency is more important but CPI is most
* i.e. CPI = 1, clock = 3GHz is better than CPI = 2, clock = 5GHz

### Rules of Thumb ###
* design for actual performance, not peak
* easier to buy bandwidth (make a second track) than latency (make the train twice as fast)

## Measurement Challenges ##
* what's faster? it depends

### Experiment Design ###
* systematic error: measurement bias
* random error: not enough runs

## CI example ##
setup: 130 experiments, mean = 45.4s, stderr = 10.1s
* what's 95% CI? look at lecture slides

## Review ISA ##
* ISA = instruction set Architecture
* software tells HW what to do, hardware tells SW what can be done
* e.g. ADD = 011001001 or whatever

## Instruction Execution Model ##
* fetch, decode, read, exec, write, next (move PC)
* computer is just FSM
* a program is just data in memory

# Aspects of ISA design #

 --> Fetch (PC) --> Decode -->  Read Input  --
 |																						|
 -- Next Instrctn <-- Write	Out <--	Execute <--

## Length ##
* when you fetch instructions, you need to know how long they are for encoding and decoding
* fixed length: most common is 32 (good for implementation/fetch, bad for density)
* variable length: vice versa
* compromise: two lengths (like MIPS16)

## Encoding ##
* machine code <--> assembly
* MIPS: all 32-bit, three types of instruction encodings, R, I and J-types
** R-type: register type, e.g. add source R1 to source R2 and store in dest R3
** I-type: immediate, e.g. add source R1 to a value and store in dest R2
** J-type: jump, goes to address (like if-then-else branch)
* x86 has variable length encoding, 1-15 bytes

## Where does data live? ##
* Registers: (e.g. R0 R1, F0)
** short term memory, named directly, fast af
** they are fast BEACUSE they are fewer of them
** not everything can be put into registers like structures, arrays, things that are pointed-to
* Memory:
** longer term memory, accessed via addressing
** e.g. (R3) = use value in R3 as an address
** e.g. #20(R5) = use value in R5 + 20 as an address
* Immediate:
** values spelled as bits

## memory addressing ##
* addressing mode: way of specifying address
* todo: REVIEW THESE!!

1. displacement
1. index-base
1. memory-indirect
1. auto-increment
1. auto-indexing
1. scaled

## control transfers ##
* default next-PC = PC + size-of(current instruction)
* computing targets
** PC-relative: for branches, e.g. bne R3 R6 L3
** absolute: for function calls, e.g. J L3
** register indirect: for returns, switches, dynamic calls e.g. JR R5
