# Lecture 2: Performance & ISA #

## Review ##
* latency, throughput, speedup
* CPI = latency, IPC = throughput
* avg performance: arithmetic, harmonic, geometric mean
* measuring CPU perf
* performance laws: amdahl's, little's laws
* benchmarks

## Amdahl's Law ##
can be applied to anything, including budgets
- improve the thing that takes up the most
- look at the video from class for
"how much does an optimization improve performance?"

## Pitfalls of Partial Performance Metrics ##
* people thing frequency is more important but CPI is most
* i.e. CPI = 1, clock = 3GHz is better than CPI = 2, clock = 5GHz

### Rules of Thumb ###
* design for actual performance, not peak
* easier to buy bandwidth (make a second track) than latency (make the train twice as fast)

## Measurement Challenges ##
* what's faster? it depends

### Experiment Design ###
* systematic error: measurement bias
* random error: not enough runs

## CI example ##
setup: 130 experiments, mean = 45.4s, stderr = 10.1s
* what's 95% CI? look at lecture slides

## Review ISA ##
* ISA = instruction set Architecture
* software tells HW what to do, hardware tells SW what can be done
* e.g. ADD = 011001001 or whatever

## Instruction Execution Model ##
* fetch, decode, read, exec, write, next (move PC)
* computer is just FSM
* a program is just data in memory

# Aspects of ISA design #

## Length ##
* when you fetch instructions, you need to know how long they are for encoding and decoding
* fixed length: most common is 32 (good for implementation/fetch, bad for density)
* variable length: vice versa
* compromise: two lengths (like MIPS16)

## Encoding ##
* machine code <--> assembly
